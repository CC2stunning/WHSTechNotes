journal (100 men Vs a gorilla)
From my personal knowledge of humans and knowing the knowledge of a silverback gorilla I 100% dont agknowldge the fact that 100 humans can take down a silver back groilla bareheanded. Yes, they may slow him down but that wont completetly stop him from destroying them. The most  you could do is to run and hide, fighting that groilla will only get humans hurt and some may die from how strong the gorilla actaully is. Gorillas weigh aproxamataly  300-500 pounds and jaws are as strong as 430 pounds and bench press around 4,000 to 5,000 pounds. Comparing that to a human that may severly hurt themselves while fighting that "unstoppable monster". I personally think as intersting as this sound; its stupid for a person to even think of trying to even go against a silverback gorilla. This "trend" really shows the true colors of people now in days on how viral they are really wilingly to go. They certainly did not post that for edgucation purposes but for entertaining purposes and it shows a lot how much they havent actaully thoght through the logic of this.
